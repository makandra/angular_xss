-# HTML attributes in Haml work in different ways:
-# 1. Under certain conditions, attributes are precompiled.
-#    We never have to escape those because they can not contain user input.
-# 2. Whenever there is a Ruby call on attributes, Haml will have to evaluate
-#    them at runtime. Since they can contain user input, XSS logic applies.

-# Precompiled:
%div(foo='{{safe}}')
%div{:class => '{{safe}}', :id => '{{safe}}'}

-# Compiled at runtime:
%div{:class => '{{unsafe}}', :id => '{{unsafe}}', :foo => rand}
%div(bar="#{'{{unsafe}}'}")
%div{:foo => '{{safe}}'.html_safe, :bar => '{{unsafe}}'}
  {{safe}}
